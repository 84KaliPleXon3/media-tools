Memory's hurt her ankle, and Edith wonders if it is 'dislocation'. Jessie, the videographer, pauses to catch a glimpse of the rising sun peering up over the horizon.

Edith Kaphuka was a 13-year-old student at Domasi Mission Primary School in Zomba District, Malawi during her Global Lives Project shoot in 2007.
