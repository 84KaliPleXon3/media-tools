2007-01-01T00:00:00Z,"In this clip, water pails in hand, Edith and Memory climb the small hill behind their home to a nearby water well. They find Elube already there, and begin to fill their buckets after she has finished. The well is unreliable and not nearly as good as the one at the Mission, according to Edith. Memory ambitiously fills her pail to the top; Edith does the same, and the girls are off down the dirt path home. They gossip about their neighbor's wardrobe and jibe one another along the way. Memory's hurt her ankle, and Edith wonders if it is 'dislocation'. Jessie, the videographer, pauses to catch a glimpse of the rising sun peering up over the horizon. This is part of a 24-hour recording of a day in the life of Edith Kaphuka, a student from Ngwale Village, Zomba District, Malawi. She was 13 years old at the time of the shoot. Edith Kaphuka was a 13-year-old student at Domasi Mission Primary School in Zomba District, Malawi during her Global Lives Project shoot in 2007. The oldest of four girls, Edith has many responsibilities at her home in Ngwale Village, such as fetching water, cleaning the dishes, and gardening. Her little sister, Memory, is her best friend; when the two are together, they are nearly inseparable. While Edith and her family are Yao, they more readily speak Chichewa, Malawi's national language.
